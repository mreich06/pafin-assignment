# Pafin Frontend assignment

This project is a responsive frontend React application built with TypeScript, Styled Components and React Spring. It was created using this [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/QTi5BGNhVQ31qdOBMg4DUp/pafin-frontend-exercise?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Z0OHx31SY7yL9Jte-1)

While writing the code for this assignment, I focused on maintaining modularity and avoiding repetition. The file structure is organized in a way that ensures readability. Variables, functions and names are given meaningful names to provide clarity and comments are provided, detailing the function of each component.
